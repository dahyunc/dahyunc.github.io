        <p>Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University, where I am affiliated with the <strong><a href="https://ddss.princeton.edu/graduate-fellows-social-data-science">Data-Driven Social Science Initiative</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://qaps.princeton.edu/">Program for Quantitative and Analytical Political Science</a></strong>.
          I work on questions in interest group politics, lobbying, regulation, climate change, and American political institutions, using methods from computational social science and applied statistics. I also develop methodological tools to improve machine learning practices in political science. </p> 
         <!--  My research interests include interest group politics, lobbying and regulations, climate change, corporate political strategy, formal and quantitative methodology. With a focus on environmental policymaking, my dissertation examines the strategic use of information by business interests in a variety of institutional contexts.\

        <p>The other stream of my research is related to computational social science. I use machine learning and applied statistical methods to quantify latent concepts in social science. I am also working to develop methodological tools to improve machine learning practices in political science research.</p>

  <div class="popup" id="abs1" style="display:none">Why do interest groups with contrasting interests and policy goals work together? This paper argues that interest groups prioritize high-quality implementation of policies even when it means compromising on their policy preferences. To test this argument, I introduce original measurement strategies to reveal the systematic patterns in which firms and environmental groups invest in joint efforts to improve the implementation of greenhouse gas emissions standards. The analysis, using public comments spanning 2010-2020, demonstrates that comments written by joint efforts of environmental groups and firms contain more informative text that can contribute to a higher quality of policy implementation, compared to individual efforts alone. While the compromise is biased in the direction of firms' interests, environmental groups can exercise meaningful influence over the finalized policy outcome by inducing more participation from the former. These findings highlight the hidden dynamics of regulatory politics, wherein divergent political goals are reconciled for high-quality policy implementation.</div>

  <div class="popup" id="abs2" style="display:none">How do interest groups use political communication to appeal to the general public? Classical accounts of interest group politics have assumed that interest groups increase voters’ knowledge about policy by informing them of expected consequences or the contents of policy. However, interest groups tend to mix two kinds of signals that are difficult to separate empirically: 1) informative signals that help voters improve political decisions, and 2) persuasive signals that influence the formation of voter preferences but don’t have direct relevance to the substantive question of interest. We create an eight-category typology for these signals and generate high-quality manual annotations of public statements and press releases distributed by interest groups. We develop an automated coding procedure using recently developed large language models, which can classify the presence of signals beyond the capacity of non-expert human coders. Our findings, drawn from illustrative examples of congressional hearings and public advertising, suggest that interest groups strategically tailor the composition of signals under different institutional settings.</div>

  <div class="popup" id="abs5" style="display:none">Statistical learning increasingly provides a bridge between theoretical concepts and empirical realities in quantitative political science research. However, many concepts of interest to scholars are both highly multidimensional and inherently fuzzy, making manual classification highly error-prone. The consequences of these issues for machine learning applications are not well understood, generating persistent uncertainty over what constitutes good enough data. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, learning from noise, taking advantage of researcher-specified bounds on conceptual complexity and labeling error to guarantee the sample size necessary to achieve a minimum level of accuracy with a precise level of confidence. We provide the scR R package online, offering a computationally efficient way to implement the proposed methods. While measurement built on clean data with well-defined concepts will always be encouraged, we aim to improve standard practices by providing a general-purpose tool to assess the feasibility of applying statistical learning models.</div>

  <div class="popup" id="abs3" style="display:none">Science is considered the primary source of information that helps regulators improve policy outcomes. However, the use of scientific information is inevitably intertwined with political reasoning. In this paper, I construct a novel dataset revealing the internal practices of science evaluation by the Environmental Protection Agency and examine how suggestions from interest groups influence the way bureaucrats evaluate science.   My empirical evidence shows that scientific studies recommended by industry are more likely to be included in final documents, regardless of subject-normalized scientific impact indicators. Using unsupervised methods, I further show that industry-endorsed scientific studies are more likely to be referenced to justify describing air pollution exposure as having no effect on public health. This paper not only provides suggestive evidence on the internal decision-making of bureaucrats, but also contributes to our understanding of the political influence of interest groups under scientific uncertainty.</div>

  <div class="popup" id="abs4" style="display:none">I develop a model of policymaking in which policy experts with asymmetric capabilities invest in joint efforts to craft high-quality proposals. While experts may have different policy preferences, they share a common interest: achieving high-quality policy implementation. Agents have asymmetric capabilities and their actions generate outcomes that vary across two dimensions: i) a distributional dimension that reflects how the divergent policy goals of the agents are reconciled, and 2) a quality dimension that represents a set of features that enhance the efficacy or equity of policy implementation. The model demonstrates that winning the ideal policy is purely instrumental as long as experts can achieve a higher quality of policy implementation, which makes compromise arise endogenously.</div>
