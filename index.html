      <section>
        <p>Hello! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University, where I am affiliated with the Data-Driven Social Science Initiative <a href="https://ddss.princeton.edu/graduate-fellows-social-data-science">(DDSS)</a> and the Program for Quantitative and Analytical Political Science <a href="https://qaps.princeton.edu/">(Q-APS)</a>. My research interests include interest group politics, lobbying and regulations, climate change, corporate political strategy, formal and quantitative methodology. My dissertation examines the strategic use of information by business interests across various institutional contexts, with a focus on climate change.</p> 

        </p>  
        The other stream of my research is related to computational social science. I use machine learning and applied statistical methods to quantify latent concepts in social science. I am also working to develop methodological tools to improve machine learning practices in political science research.
        </p>

<b> <a href="documents/Climate_Info_Environment.pdf"> Teaming Up across Political Divides: Evidence from Climate Regulations</a></b> (Previously titled  "Teaming up with the Enemy: Firms and the Information Environment of Climate Regulations")
<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('te');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="te" style="display:none;"><br>Why do interest groups with contrasting interests and policy goals work together? This paper argues that interest groups prioritize high-quality implementation of policies even when it means compromising on their policy preferences. To test this argument, I introduce original measurement strategies to reveal the systematic patterns in which firms and environmental groups invest in joint efforts to improve the implementation of greenhouse gas emissions standards. The analysis, using public comments spanning 2010-2020, demonstrates that comments written by joint efforts of environmental groups and firms contain more informative text that can contribute to a higher quality of policy implementation, compared to individual efforts alone. While the compromise is biased in the direction of firms' interests, environmental groups can exercise meaningful influence over the finalized policy outcome by inducing more participation from the former. These findings highlight the hidden dynamics of regulatory politics, wherein divergent political goals are reconciled for high-quality policy implementation.</div>

<li> <a href="">Quantifying Informative Signals from Political Texts </a></b> (with Brandon Stewart and Denis Peskov)
<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('quant');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="quant" style="display:none;"><br> How do interest groups use political communication to appeal to the general public?  Interest groups tend to mix two kinds of signals that are hard to separate empirically: 1) informative signals that help voters improve political decisions and 2) persuasive signals that influence the preference formation of votes but don't have direct relevance to the substantive question of interest.  We create an eight-category typology of these signals and generate high-quality manual annotations of public statements and press releases distributed by interest groups, beyond a simple dichotomous framework. We develop an automated coding procedure using recently-developed large language models that can classify the presence of signals above the level of non-expert human coders.  Our findings, drawn from illustrative examples of congressional hearings and public advertising, suggest that interest groups strategically tailor the composition of signals under different institutional settings. </div>

<li> Learning from Noise: The Application of Sample Complexity for Political Science Research (with Perry Carter)
  <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('noise');">[Abstract]</a></i>
  <div id="noise" style="display:none;"><br> Statistical learning increasingly serves as a bridge between concepts and the intricate empirical realities within quantitative political science research. However, numerous concepts of interest to scholars are both highly multidimensional and inherently fuzzy, rendering even manual classification error-prone. Addressing the enduring uncertainty surrounding the definition of "good enough" data, we present a novel framework called "learning from noise," which leverages researcher-specified bounds on labeling errors to ensure a sufficient sample size for achieving a minimum level of accuracy.  While measurement built on clean data with well-defined concepts will always be encouraged, we aim to improve standard practices by providing a general-purpose tool to validate the quality of measures when fuzzy boundaries of measurement make generating data with ground-truth labels unfeasible. </div>

<li> Investing in Team Efforts: When Agents with Contrasting Preferences Collaborate  </i> 
  <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('fm');">[Abstract]</a></i>
  <div id="fm" style="display:none;"><br>  I develop a model of policymaking in which policy experts with asymmetric capabilities invest in joint efforts to craft high-quality proposals. While experts may have different policy preferences, they share a common interest: achieving high-quality policy implementation. Agents have asymmetric capabilities and their actions generate outcomes that vary across two dimensions: i) a distributional dimension that reflects how the divergent policy goals of the agents are reconciled, and 2) a quality dimension that represents reflects a set of features that enhance the efficacy or equity of policy implementation. The model demonstrates that winning the ideal policy is purely instrumental as long as experts can achieve a higher quality of policy implementation, which makes compromise arise endogenously. </div>
